# Fractal Tree Drawing Program

## üå≥ Summary
This program draws **colorful fractal trees** using the ROS 2 `turtlesim` simulator. It begins with a trunk and recursively generates branching patterns, creating vivid and diverse tree structures.

---

## üì¶ Program Overview

The program leverages ROS 2 and turtlesim to simulate fractal tree generation through turtle motion commands. Branches are recursively drawn and colored based on depth and selected styles.

### Key Methods

- `__init__`: Initializes the drawer with user-specified parameters (depth, angle, colors).
- `draw_fractal`: Main method to initiate drawing of the trunk and branches.
- `draw_branch`: Recursive function that creates branches and sub-branches up to a specified depth.
- `get_color`: Determines the color of each branch based on depth and the selected scheme.
- `draw_line`, `change_pen`, `teleport_to`: Utility functions to control the turtle's movement and drawing actions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Ensure you have a working ROS 2 setup.
2. Launch the turtlesim node:
   ```bash
   ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
